<!-- Root README:

A collection of web components, for a modern (ES modules) web app.

This is like the stuff that collects in the pockets - keys, screw drivers, what not.

|Component|Used for|
|---|---|
|[`aside-keys`](packages/aside-keys/README.md)|Authenticate with Firebase|

## Playground

tbd. place testing link in the GitHub description, once deployed

..or maybe make a 'playground' link, above?

## Approach

Keep the code **simple**.

## Requirements

- node

### Google Identity Platform application or Firebase application

To use `aside-keys`, you need to create a Google Identity Platform project (which automatically creates a Firebase project of the same id), or a Firebase web project.

>Note: Google Identity Platform is essentially Firebase auth on steroids (without needing to use Firebase for anything else). Their APIs are the same.

In particular:

- get "API key" and "auth domain" from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). <sub>[instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys)</sub>
  - create a "web app" entry for this
  - create a file `.env.local` that carries those keys:

   ```
   # .env.local
   VITE_API_KEY=AIza...
   VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=....firebaseapp.com
   ```

Note that the degree of secrecy concerning those values is arguable. On the one side, they are visible for anyone using your web app. On the other, Google recommends *not* keeping them in version control.

It also seems that whether you create the values via Firebase or Google Identity Platform might affect this. If you use the latter, restrict their powers to authentication only:

1. Google Cloud console > `APIs & Services` > `Credentials` > `API Keys` > `Browser key (auto created by Firebase)` (click)
2. `API Restrictions` > `Restrict key` > `[x] Identity Toolkit API`
