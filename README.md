The author is needing such a component for a Firebase web project. Other auth frameworks can be considered (file an Issue/PR).

### Simplicity

One of the aims is to keep the code **simple**.

No considerations of platforms other than the web.

### Not knowing one's users' passwords

No consideration of authentication mechanisms that involve asking the user a plain text password.
